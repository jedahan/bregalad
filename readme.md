## Installation and Deployment
 
The API requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org) v0.11.x, [coffeescript](http://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript) trunk, and is built on the [koa](koajs.com) web framework.

The recommended setup is to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to handle installing and using the correct version of node when doing `npm install` and `npm start`.
